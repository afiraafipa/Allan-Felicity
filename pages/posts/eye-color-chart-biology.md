Green is recessive to brown but dominant to blue. At many department of motor vehicle (dmv) offices, eye charts are used by employees to check the vision of people applying for or renewing their driver’s licenses. The two main gene pairs geneticists have focused on are eycl1 (also called the gey gene) and eycl3 (also called the bey2 gene).
